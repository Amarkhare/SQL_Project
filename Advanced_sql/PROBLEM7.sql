Determine the size category('Small', 'Medium', or 'Large')for each company by 
first identifying the numbr of job postings they have. Use a subquery to calculate
the total job posting per company.A company is considerd 'Small' if it has less than 10 
job postings, 'Medium' if the number of job postings is between 10 and 50 and 'Large'
if it has more than 50 job postings. Implement a subquery to aggregate job counts per 
company before classifying them based on size
